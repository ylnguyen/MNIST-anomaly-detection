# MNIST-anomaly-detection

This is a small experiment that uses MNIST-digit dataset to perform anomaly detection. Two autoencoder model based on fully-connected layers and convolutional layers are trained on the dataset and learn how to reconstruct the digit. The models use the MSE or SSIM loss function to determine outliers. The pipeline and the results can be observed in the main.ipynb file.
